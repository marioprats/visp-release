  \brief Functionality computation for basic moment feature. Computes the interaction matrix associated with vpMomentBasic.

    The interaction matrix for the basic moment feature is defined in [1] "Point-based and region-based image moments for visual servoing of planar objects" by Omar Tahri and Francois Chaumette, equation (13).
    This vpFeatureMoment, as well as it's corresponding moment primitive is double-indexed.
    The interaction matrix \f$ L_{m_{ij}} \f$ is obtained by calling vpFeatureMomentBasic::interaction (i,j) and is associated to \f$ m_{ij} \f$ obtained by vpMomentBasic::get (i,j).
    vpFeatureMomentBasic computes interaction matrices all interaction matrices up to vpMomentObject::getOrder()-1.
    \attention The maximum order reached by vpFeatureMomentBasic is NOT the maximum order of the vpMomentObject, it is one unit smaller.
    For example if you define your vpMomentObject up to order n then vpFeatureMomentBasic will be able to compute interaction matrices up to order n-1 that is
    \f$ L_{m_{ij}} \f$ with \f$ i+j<=n-1 \f$.

    You can see an example of vpFeatureMomentBasic by looking at the documentation of the vpFeatureMoment class.

    This feature depends on:
