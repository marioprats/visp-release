ViSP 2.6.2 (released July 15, 2012)
  - New features
     - New vp1394CMUGrabber class that allows firewire frame acquisition
       under Windows using CMU 1394 Digital Camera 3rd party library.
       Thanks to Lucas Lopes Lemos and Guillaume Laurent from FEMTO-ST,
       AS2M departement, Besancon, France for this contribution.
     - New vpPioneer, vpPioneerPan, vpRobotPioneer classes to control Pioneer
       mobile robots using Aria 3rd party library.
     - New vpFeatureSegment class to consider a segment as a visual
       servoing feature. Normalized and non normalized features are considered.
     - New vpFeatureMomentArea class to consider moment area as a visual feature.
     - Introduction of new functionalities in vpIoTools to parse text
       config files
     - Introduction of YARP to ViSP image converters in vpImageConvert
     - New vpClient and vpServer classes for a multiclients TCP network.
     - New vpPoseFeatures class for pose computation from any visual features.
       To be able to consider other user defined features the compiler should
       be compatible with C++ 11 standart.
  - Improvements
     - Introduce a new Denavit Hartenberg representation of the Biclops head
       in vpBiclops.
     - Compatibility with g++ 4.7 and OpenCV 2.3.1, 2.4.0, 2.4.1
     - Remove warning detected with Visual C++ /Wall flag
     - Use CMake native package finder for zlib, png, jpeg, coin3d, gtk2 and
       doxygen 3rd party libraries detection. If detection fails, we use our
       own package finder.
     - Under Windows, changes done to add "d" suffix to the library name when
       build in debug (libvisp-2d.lib and libvisp-2d.dll). Install stage
       copy libvisp-2[d].lib in $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib and libvisp-2[d].dll
       in $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin.
     - Use OpenMP to optimize the execution of the moments computation.
     - Possibility to compute the covariance matrix during pose estimation
       (vpPose and vpPoseFeatures) and model-based tracking (vpMbTracker).
     - All initClick() now have a non-blocking equivalent as initFromPoints(),
       or initFromPose(), etc.
     - Most of the classes that had a display() method now have the equivalent
       display in static function (display's externalisation).
     - Ransac is now improved for either pose computation or point matching.
  - Examples:
     - New example plot3d.cpp to show how to plot 3D curves
     - New example movePioneer.cpp to illustrate Pioneer velocity control.
     - New example sonarPioneerReader.cpp to illustrate Pioneer sonar device usage.
     - New examples servoPioneerPoint2DDepth.cpp,
       servoPioneerPoint2DDepthWithoutVpServo.cpp and servoPioneerPanSegment3D.cpp
       to show how to control the pioneer mobile robot by IBVS.
     - New example grab1394CMU.cpp to show how to acquire images with
       the CMU 1394 library.

    - vpDisplayX : better management of endianness
    - vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D, vpDisplayX :
        To actually display drawings on the screen, a vpDisplay::flush(I) is
        needed. Use it with parsimony : it is time consuming.
    - vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D :
        The behavior of the following methods change to be similar
        to vpDisplayX:
        . getClick(..., button) : The button used to click is now an output
        . getClickUp(..., button) : The button used to click is now an output
        Moreover, in vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D middle button is now managed
    - vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D :
        The usage of display->init(vpImage, int, int); returned a
        segmentation fault : bug fixed
    - vpDisplayD3D : we couldn't re-use a display after the call of the
        function close(vpImage). We had a black image : bug fixed.
    - vpDisplay : changes in displayRectangle():an option parameter
        fill has been had to precise if the displayed rectangle is filled
        or not.
    - vpColor : Add orange color.
    - vpServo : To fix bug #3528 you should explicitly call vpServo::kill()
        in your programs. Otherwise an exception
        vpServoException::notKilledProperly is launched by
        vpServo::~vpServo() destructor.
    - vpMatrix : Change Infinity Norm and Euclidian Norm formula to match with
	the standard matrix norms definitions.
        Change determinant formula for 3x3 matrices to match with
        the standard determinant definition.
    - vpImageConvert :
	Add IplImage to vpImage and vpImage to IplImage conversion tool.
	Add MONO16 to grey (MONO8) conversion tool.
    - vp1394TwoGrabber :
	Supports libdc1394-2.0.0-rc7 and libdc1394-2.0.1
	MONO16 color coding is supported

    - test/visual-feature/testFeature.cpp was added
    - test/image/testCreateSubImage.cpp was added
    - test/camera/testCameraParametersConversion.cpp was added
    - Documentation improvement
    - vpRobust::MEstimator()
    - vpRobotAfma6: example usage of getPosition() was updated
    - vpDisplayGDI is included in the doxygen documentation

ViSP 2.4.1 (released May 16th, 2007)
  - New classes
        - vpRect class for rectangle manipulations, display
        - vpHistogram,vpHistogramPeak and vpHistogramValey classes to
	  handle gray level image histogram
	- vpSubPixel for sub-pixel manipulations
	- vpMouseButton for mouse click identification
  - New Features
        - MinGW supported
	- ViSP as a third party library in an other project.
	  It is now possible to use ViSP as a third party project without
	  installing ViSP by make install. ViSP can now be used
	  directly from the build dir, or from the install dir, or
	  from a package (NSIS, ...)
	- vpRobotCamera It is now possible to add a sampling time so that
          the behavior of this simulated camera is quite realistic. This
	  sampling time is set by default to 40 ms.
	- vpExponentialMap A sampling time was introduced.
  - Bug fix and improvement
	- vpImage: getWidth() and getHeight() replace getCols() and getRows()
	  which are now obsolete.
	- More restrictive types in vpImage, vpDisplay..., and vp...Grabber
	  classes: const are added, unsigned int replace int for pixel
	  manipulations and image or display size.
	- In vpDisplay classes:
	  . vpMouseButton::vpMouseButtonType was introduced to handle
	    mouse clicks
	  . vpColor::vpColorType was introduced to handle colors to display
	- Simulator functionality based on Coin usage is now available
	  under windows. It allows the use of vpSimulator class under this
	  platform.
	- Compatibility with Windows platform.
	- Reference documentation improvement
	- cfox and std namespace were removed. To use cout you need to call
	  std::cout, std::endl, std::cin ...

----------------------------------------------
ViSP 2.4.0 (released February 6th, 2007)
  - New Feature
	- add new framegrabber interface for itifg8 driver from Coreco
	  Imaging Technology (http://sourceforge.net/projects/itifg)
	  Tested with AM-STD COMP framegrabber board on 2.4 and 2.6
	  linux kernel (see vpItifg8Grabber).
	- add new framegrabber interface and test for firewire 1394
	  cameras using libdc1394-2.x. Need a newer version than
	  libdc1394-2.0.0-rc4.
	  Tested with the svn version of libdc1394-2 and Marlin F033C and
          F131B cameras (see vp1394TwoGrabber). Format 7 is supported
	  in vp1394TwoGrabber.
	  vp1394Grabber will be obsolete soon.
